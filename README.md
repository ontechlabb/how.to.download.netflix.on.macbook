Netflix is, in every way, one of the most popular streaming services out there. Not only can you watch movies and TV shows online through the Netflix app or your browser, but you can also download content to your device for offline viewing.

The truth is that there is no Netflix app for macOS. While on all other devices—such as iPhones, Androids, and Windows smartphones—you can just install the Netflix app and use it to save movies and TV shows for offline viewing, it's impossible to do so on a Mac.

Instead, Mac users need to access their Netflix account through a browser like Safari, Google Chrome, Opera, or any other. All you need to do is visit the official Netflix website and sign in.

People who want to download Netflix movies to their MacBook, iMac, or Mac mini sometimes use risky workarounds, such as installing apps that look similar to Netflix.

You should be very careful with such apps, as they usually contain malware.

Since there isn't a Netflix app designed specifically for Mac users yet, don't try to download suspicious apps from the web. The only Netflix apps you can trust are those on the official Netflix website.
